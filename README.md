# Time-Series-Forecasting-K-Nearest-Neighbors
In this repository you can find the Python code and the data to get the results shown in my dissertation. The title of the dissertation is "The KNN Algorithm for Financial Time Series: a New Python Implementation". The main goal of the project is to make forecasts on a financial historical series using the well-known KNN machine learning algorithm.
